## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To install this package, add it as a dependency to your project's manifest file (`Package.swift`), e.g., a package named `"Example"` whose main product is a library with no dependencies other than MirrorExtensions would be defined as such:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Example",
  products: [
    .library(name: "Example", targets: ["Example"])
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/dennisvennink/MirrorExtensions.git", from: "1.0.1")
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(name: "Example", dependencies: ["MirrorExtensions"]),
    .testTarget(name: "ExampleTests", dependencies: ["Example"])
  ]
)
```

Then, `import` it into your project:

```swift
import MirrorExtensions
```

## Contributing

```

When you're done implementing your feature, commit your changes:

```shell
git commit -am "Add some new feature"
```

Then push to the feature branch:

```shell
git push origin my-new-feature
```

Finally, submit a pull request!

## Testing

```shell
swift test
```

## API

### Instance Method Extensions On `Mirror`

#### `children(_ type:)`

Creates a `Collection` that contains, as elements, all of the children of `self` that conform to `T`.

##### Example

```swift
struct Struct {
  let boolean1 = true
  let integer1 = 1
  let string1 = "a"
  let boolean2 = false
  let integer2 = 2
  let string2 = "b"
  let integer3 = 3
}

print(Mirror(reflecting: Struct()).children(Int.self))
// [1, 2, 3]
```

##### Declaration

```swift
func children <T> (_ type: T.Type) -> [T]
```

##### Parameters

None.

##### Returns

A `Collection` that contains, as elements, all of the children of `self` that conform to `T`.
